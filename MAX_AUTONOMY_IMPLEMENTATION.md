# Max-Autonomy CopilotKit Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented max-autonomy prompting and context engineering for the CopilotKit-powered Chrome extension agent to minimize refusals and maximize autonomous task execution.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Instructions (`src/sidepanel.tsx`)

#### Primary Directive (Description)
Replaced generic description with **MAX-AUTONOMY** directive:
- Explicitly instructs agent to COMPLY and EXECUTE user requests
- Only refuse if: illegal, unsafe/harmful, or requires missing credentials
- **CRITICAL: NEVER refuse knowledge questions** - use browser to search and find answers
- Always attempt tool-based solutions; never ask for confirmation
- Verify results independently and report outcomes

#### Behavior Guidelines (Expanded)
Added comprehensive behavior rules:
- **NON-REFUSAL POLICY**: Attempt any safe, legal request using tools
- **KNOWLEDGE QUESTIONS**: NEVER refuse to answer - navigate to Google/Bing, search, read results, provide answer
- **EXECUTE FIRST**: Use tools immediately; only ask for user data when absolutely required
- **VERIFY YOURSELF**: Check outcomes via readPageContent/getSelectedText/getActiveTab
- **NO DUPLICATE LOOPS**: Never retry identical calls; stop on duplicate/frame-removed errors
- **STRUCTURED RETRIES**: Only retry after state changes with exponential backoff
- **MULTI-APPROACH**: Try alternate selectors (role/text/aria-label) when primary fails

#### Tool Playbook (New Section)
Decision tree for tool usage:
- **ANSWERING QUESTIONS**: For ANY knowledge question, navigate to Google with query, readPageContent, extract answer
- **SEARCH WORKFLOW**: (1) navigateTo Google/Bing, (2) readPageContent results, (3) extract info, (4) report answer
- **NAVIGATION**: When to use navigateTo; tab reuse strategy
- **DOM INSPECTION**: Pre-interaction checks with readPageContent
- **INTERACTION SEQUENCE**: 4-step process (verify → scroll → interact → validate)
- **SELECTOR STRATEGIES**: CSS → aria-label → text fallback hierarchy
- **FORM FILLING**: fillInput + pressKey Enter pattern
- **VALIDATION**: Always read back after write operations
- **TAB MANAGEMENT**: searchTabs before openTab
- **MCP TOOLS**: When to use Notion/other MCP services

#### Error Recovery (New Section)
Taxonomy of errors with recovery strategies:
- **DON'T KNOW ANSWER**: NEVER say "I cannot answer" - navigate to Google/Bing, search, provide answer
- **NAVIGATION RACE** ('Frame removed'): STOP; wait for next instruction
- **DUPLICATE ACTION BLOCKED**: Report; suggest different approach
- **SELECTOR NOT FOUND**: Try alternates; if fail, read page and report options
- **PERMISSION DENIED**: Explain requirement; suggest alternatives
- **TIMEOUT/NETWORK**: Single retry after 2s; then report

### 2. Dynamic Context (State Tracking)

#### Current Tab Tracking
- Polls active tab every 2 seconds
- Provides real-time URL and title to agent
- Enables context-aware decisions

#### Recent Actions Memory
- Extracts last 3 assistant messages
- Shows tool outcomes and approximate timing
- Prevents repetitive actions with same parameters

#### Context Structure
```typescript
currentContext: {
  platform: "Chrome Extension",
  location: "Side Panel",
  runMode: "execute-verify-report",
  activeTab: { url, title },      // Real-time tab state
  recentActions: [...]             // Last 3 actions
}
```

### 3. UI Enhancements (`src/components/CopilotChatWindow.tsx`)

Updated empty state message:
- "autonomous AI assistant" (was "AI assistant")
- "execute tasks end-to-end" messaging
- Clear capability statement (browse, click, fill forms, tabs)

## Key Principles Applied

### Context Engineering
1. **Dynamic Context Management**: Real-time tab state polling
2. **Tool Integration**: Explicit playbook for when/how to use each tool
3. **Memory Management**: Recent actions prevent loops

### Prompt Engineering Techniques
1. **In-Context Learning**: Tool playbook provides usage examples
2. **Chain-of-Thought**: INTERACTION SEQUENCE guides step-by-step reasoning
3. **Error Handling**: Explicit error taxonomy with recovery paths
4. **Zero-Refusal Framing**: "attempt first, refuse only when blocked" policy

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before
- Agent asks for permission before actions
- Refuses tasks due to uncertainty
- Retries same failed actions repeatedly
- Generic error messages without recovery guidance

### After
- Agent executes immediately; verifies independently
- Attempts tool-based solutions before refusing
- Stops on duplicate/frame errors; suggests alternatives
- Structured error recovery with fallback strategies
- Context-aware decisions based on active tab and recent actions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Navigation Tests**: Request multi-step browsing tasks
2. **Form Filling**: Test form interactions without explicit selectors
3. **Error Recovery**: Trigger duplicate actions; verify agent stops and reports
4. **Context Awareness**: Request actions on current page without specifying URL
5. **MCP Integration**: Test Notion operations when authenticated

## Files Modified

1. `src/sidepanel.tsx` - Enhanced useCopilotReadable with max-autonomy instructions
2. `src/components/CopilotChatWindow.tsx` - Updated UI messaging

## Compliance with Research

Implementation incorporates:
- **Context Engineering**: Dynamic environment awareness, tool descriptions, state tracking
- **Advanced Prompting**: In-context learning, structured reasoning, error classification
- **Non-Refusal Strategy**: Comply-then-warn policy, attempt-first directive
- **Loop Prevention**: Duplicate detection, frame-removed handling, structured retries
