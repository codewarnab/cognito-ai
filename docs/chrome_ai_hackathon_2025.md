## 3. Who can participate

- Individuals and teams (students, professionals, hobbyists).  
- Participants worldwide, subject to the official rules and eligibility requirements listed in the contest rules (e.g., legal capability to enter contests in their country).

---

## 4. Registration & submissions

- **Platform:** Devpost (official event page). Create an account (or sign in) and submit your project there following the Devpost submission flow.  
- **What to submit:** Working web app or Chrome Extension that uses one or more of the supported built-in AI APIs and demonstrates integration with Chrome’s AI features. Include code repository link, demo video/screenshots, a clear description, and required metadata per Devpost.

---

## 5. Allowed technologies & recommended APIs

- **Gemini Nano** (on-device/low-latency model where applicable).  
- **Chrome Built-in AI APIs** (WebAI, extension API samples, Prompt API/Origin trial where applicable).  
- **Standard web stack:** HTML/CSS/JS, WebExtensions APIs, WebAssembly, frameworks (React/Vue/Svelte), and any standard third‑party libraries you prefer — so long as the project demonstrates usage of the built-in AI capabilities.

## 6. Prizes & awards

- The event lists a prize pool and multiple award categories (for example: Best Use of Gemini, cash and sponsor-specific awards). Prize amounts and categories may vary; summary materials on the Devpost landing page and official resources indicate a sizable prize pool and sponsor awards.

## 7. Judging criteria

Typical judging focuses on (but is not limited to):

- **Technical merit & originality** — clever use of built-in AI and models.  
- **User experience & polish** — how polished, intuitive, and useful the app/extension is.  
- **Feasibility & performance** — working demo, responsiveness (on-device benefits), and reproducibility.  
- **Impact & usefulness** — the problem solved and breadth of user benefit.

Refer to the official rules and rubric for exact scoring and category-specific criteria.

## 8. Rules & legal notes (high level)

- The official rules define eligibility, intellectual property expectations, judging process, and other legal details.  
- Projects must abide by Devpost rules and the hackathon-specific official rules (read these carefully before submitting).  
- Some APIs may require enrollment in a trial or access program (Prompt API origin trial, for example).

---

## 9. Resources (technical & learning)

- **Official Devpost event page** — submission, prizes, project gallery, Q&A, updates, and rules.  
- **Chrome Developers blog & docs** — walkthroughs, examples, extension samples, and Web AI demos presented at Google I/O 2025.  
- **Code examples & samples** — extension API samples, web AI demos (code provided in resource lists).  

Make sure to bookmark the official resources and sample repositories so you can reproduce demos locally.

## 10. How to prepare (practical checklist)

1. Read the official rules and prize categories.  
2. Set up a Devpost account and review submission requirements.  
3. Try Chrome’s built-in AI samples and tutorials (I/O demos, extension samples).  
4. Prototype early using Gemini Nano or other supported models/APIs.  
5. Record a short demo video (60–180 seconds) showing the app in action.  
6. Prepare a clean README and deploy a live demo if possible (host on GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).  
7. Test on multiple platforms and ensure you’ve documented any setup steps.

## 11. Project idea prompts (starter inspirations)

- **Private summarizer extension:** On-device summarization of long web pages without sending data to servers.  
- **Smart research assistant:** Context-aware note-taking that extracts citations and sources while browsing.  
- **Accessibility helper:** Real-time voice explanations or simplified text for users with reading difficulties.  
- **Developer tool:** On-device code summarizer or auto-comment generator for GitHub PR pages.

## 12. FAQ (short)

**Q:** Do I need Google Cloud/Gemini keys?  
**A:** Some features may require enrollment or API access; follow the event resources and prompt API origin trial instructions.

**Q:** Can I use third-party LLMs?  
**A:** The challenge emphasizes Chrome’s built-in AI and Gemini Nano — using external models is possible but make sure the core experience highlights the built-in AI capabilities.
