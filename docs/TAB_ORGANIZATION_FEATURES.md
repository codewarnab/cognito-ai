# 🎯 Intelligent Tab Organization Features

## Overview
Your Chrome AI Assistant now has **context-aware intelligent tab organization** that groups tabs based on their content, topic, and purpose - not just by domain.

## 🚀 New Features Added

### 1. **organizeTabsByContext** (AI-Powered Smart Grouping)
Intelligently analyzes all open tabs and groups them by topic/project/research context.

**How it works:**
1. AI calls `organizeTabsByContext` 
2. System extracts tab titles, URLs, and domains
3. AI analyzes the data to identify related topics
4. AI creates meaningful groups (e.g., "React Development", "Job Search", "Travel Planning")
5. AI calls `applyTabGroups` with the suggested grouping
6. System creates colored tab groups in Chrome

**Example use cases:**
- User: "Organize my tabs intelligently"
- User: "Group my tabs by what I'm working on"
- User: "Smart organize my tabs"

**What the AI does:**
- Groups tabs about React (even from GitHub, StackOverflow, MDN, blogs)
- Groups job search tabs (LinkedIn, company sites, job boards)
- Groups shopping tabs (different stores, product comparisons)
- Groups research tabs on same topic (various news sites, wikis, docs)

### 2. **organizeTabsByDomain** (Simple Domain Grouping)
Groups tabs by website domain (all github.com together, all google.com together, etc.)

**Use cases:**
- User: "Group tabs by website"
- User: "Organize by domain"

### 3. **applyTabGroups** (Apply AI Suggestions)
Takes AI-analyzed groups and creates actual Chrome tab groups with:
- Descriptive names
- Different colors
- Tab counts
- Descriptions

## 📊 Visual Feedback
All tools provide rich UI feedback showing:
- ✅ Groups created
- 📊 Tab counts per group
- 🎨 Color-coded visual cards
- 📝 Group descriptions

## 🎨 Example Grouping

**Before:**
- GitHub React docs
- StackOverflow React question
- LinkedIn job posting
- Indeed job search
- Amazon product
- Google search results
- MDN JavaScript docs

**After AI Analysis:**
- **React Development** (3 tabs)
  - GitHub React docs
  - StackOverflow React question  
  - MDN JavaScript docs
  
- **Job Search** (2 tabs)
  - LinkedIn job posting
  - Indeed job search
  
- **Shopping** (1 tab)
  - Amazon product

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Required Permission
Added `tabGroups` permission to manifest for Chrome Tab Groups API (Chrome 89+)

### Tools Created
1. `organizeTabsByContext` - Prepares tabs for AI analysis
2. `applyTabGroups` - Creates physical tab groups
3. `organizeTabsByDomain` - Simple domain-based grouping

### AI Instructions
The AI is instructed to:
- Analyze tab titles and URLs for context
- Identify common topics/projects/research
- Create 3-7 meaningful groups
- Use descriptive names and descriptions
- Call applyTabGroups to finalize

## 💡 Usage Examples

```
User: "Organize my tabs"
→ AI uses organizeTabsByContext
→ Analyzes all tabs
→ Groups by topic
→ Creates visual groups

User: "Group by website"
→ AI uses organizeTabsByDomain
→ Groups github.com, google.com, etc.
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Context-Aware**: Understands what tabs are about, not just where they're from
2. **Intelligent**: Groups related work even across different websites
3. **Visual**: Color-coded groups with clear names
4. **Flexible**: Supports both smart and simple grouping
5. **User-Friendly**: Natural language commands

## 🔄 Next Steps

To use:
1. Rebuild extension: `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build`
2. Reload extension in Chrome
3. Ask: "Organize my tabs intelligently"
4. Watch the AI analyze and group your tabs!

## 📝 Notes

- Requires Chrome 89+ for Tab Groups API
- Skips chrome:// and extension URLs
- Groups only valid tabs with accessible URLs
- Minimum 2 tabs needed to create a group (by domain)
- AI creates 3-7 contextual groups based on content
