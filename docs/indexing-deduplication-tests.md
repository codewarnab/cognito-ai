/**
 * Test scenarios for indexing deduplication
 * 
 * These are manual test scenarios to verify the implementation works correctly.
 */

// Scenario 1: Recently indexed page
// 1. Visit a page (e.g., https://example.com)
// 2. Wait for it to be indexed (check processing status)
// 3. Refresh the page immediately
// Expected: Console log should show "Skipping enqueue - URL was recently indexed"

// Scenario 2: Currently processing page
// 1. Visit multiple pages to build up a queue
// 2. While processing is ongoing, visit one of the pages in the current batch
// Expected: Console log should show "Skipping enqueue - URL is currently being processed"

// Scenario 3: After TTL expires
// 1. Visit a page and wait for it to be indexed
// 2. Wait for 6 minutes (TTL is 5 minutes)
// 3. Visit the same page again
// Expected: Page should be enqueued normally (no skip message)

// Scenario 4: Different pages
// 1. Visit page A
// 2. Visit page B
// Expected: Both pages should be enqueued normally

// To check console logs:
// 1. Open Chrome DevTools
// 2. Go to the Extension's service worker (chrome://extensions -> Developer mode -> Inspect views: service worker)
// 3. Check the Console tab for log messages

/**
 * Helper: Check if URL was recently indexed
 * Run this in the service worker console to check cache state
 */
function checkRecentlyIndexed(url: string) {
    // This would need to be exposed via message handler if you want to check from popup/content
    // For now, you can check the console logs when pages are visited
}

/**
 * Helper: View current processing batch
 * Send this message from content script or popup
 */
async function viewProcessingBatch() {
    const response = await chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'GetProcessingStatus' });
    console.log('Current batch:', response.status.currentBatch);
    console.log('Is processing:', response.status.isProcessing);
}

/**
 * Configuration values to be aware of:
 * - RECENTLY_INDEXED_TTL_MS: 5 minutes (300,000 ms)
 * - COALESCE_BUCKET_MS: 1 minute (60,000 ms)
 * 
 * The recently indexed check prevents reindexing within 5 minutes.
 * The coalesce key groups visits within 1-minute buckets.
 * These work together to prevent duplicate processing.
