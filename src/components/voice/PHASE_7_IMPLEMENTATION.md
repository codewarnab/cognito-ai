# Phase 7: Mode Integration - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Phase 7 successfully integrates the mode toggle and voice mode into the main sidepanel, allowing users to seamlessly switch between text and voice chat modes.

## Components Created

### 1. ModeToggle Component
**File**: `src/components/ModeToggle.tsx`

A toggle component that allows switching between text and voice modes.

**Features**:
- Visual indication of active mode
- Icon-based buttons with labels
- Disabled state during recording
- Responsive design (hides labels on small screens)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Glassmorphism design matching the app theme

**Props**:
```typescript
interface ModeToggleProps {
    mode: ChatMode;              // Current mode ('text' | 'voice')
    onModeChange: (mode: ChatMode) => void;  // Mode change handler
    disabled?: boolean;          // Disable toggle during recording
}
```

**Usage**:
```tsx
<ModeToggle
    mode={mode}
    onModeChange={handleModeChange}
    disabled={isRecording}
/>
```

### 2. ModeToggle Styles
**File**: `src/components/ModeToggle.css`

**Design Features**:
- Glassmorphism effect with backdrop blur
- Active state with gradient border
- Hover and active animations
- Responsive behavior
- Accessible design with proper contrast

## Integration Changes

### SidePanel Component Updates
**File**: `src/sidepanel.tsx`

**Key Changes**:

1. **New Imports**:
```tsx
import { ModeToggle, type ChatMode } from "./components/ModeToggle";
import { VoiceModeUI } from "./components/voice/VoiceModeUI";
```

2. **New State**:
```tsx
const [mode, setMode] = useState<ChatMode>('text');
const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState<string>('');
```

3. **API Key Loading**:
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
    const loadApiKey = async () => {
        const result = await chrome.storage.local.get(['apiKey']);
        if (result.apiKey) {
            setApiKey(result.apiKey);
        }
    };
    loadApiKey();
}, []);
```

4. **Mode Change Handler**:
```tsx
const handleModeChange = async (newMode: ChatMode) => {
    if (mode === newMode) return;
    
    // Prevent switching during active recording
    if (isRecording) {
        log.warn('Cannot switch mode while recording');
        return;
    }
    
    log.info('Switching mode', { from: mode, to: newMode });
    setMode(newMode);
};
```

5. **Conditional Rendering**:
```tsx
{/* Mode Toggle - Only show when not recording */}
{(mode === 'text' || !isRecording) && (
    <div className="mode-toggle-wrapper">
        <ModeToggle
            mode={mode}
            onModeChange={handleModeChange}
            disabled={isRecording}
        />
    </div>
)}

{/* Conditional rendering based on mode */}
{mode === 'text' ? (
    <>
        <CopilotChatWindow ... />
        <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
            {showPill && (
                <motion.div className="voice-recording-pill">
                    {/* Recording pill for text mode voice input */}
                </motion.div>
            )}
        </AnimatePresence>
    </>
) : (
    <VoiceModeUI
        onBack={() => setMode('text')}
        apiKey={apiKey}
        systemInstruction="..."
    />
)}
```

### SidePanel Styles
**File**: `src/sidepanel.css`

**New Styles**:
```css
.mode-toggle-wrapper {
    position: fixed;
    top: 12px;
    right: 12px;
    z-index: 1000;
    animation: fadeInDown 0.3s ease;
}
```

## User Experience

### Switching Modes

1. **Text to Voice**:
   - Click "Voice" button in mode toggle
   - Sidepanel transitions to full-screen voice mode
   - Audio orb appears with controls
   - Text chat UI is hidden

2. **Voice to Text**:
   - Click "< Back to Text" in voice mode header
   - Or click "Text" in mode toggle (if visible)
   - Voice session is cleanly stopped (if active)
   - Returns to text chat UI

### Safety Features

1. **Recording Protection**:
   - Mode toggle is disabled during text mode voice recording
   - Prevents accidental mode switch while speaking

2. **State Isolation**:
   - Text mode and voice mode have separate states
   - No shared conversation context (by design)
   - Each mode operates independently

3. **Clean Transitions**:
   - Mode changes are logged for debugging
   - Smooth animations using Framer Motion
   - Proper cleanup on mode change

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Mode toggle renders correctly
- [x] Can switch from text to voice mode
- [x] Can switch from voice to text mode
- [x] Mode toggle is disabled during recording
- [x] VoiceModeUI receives correct props
- [x] API key is loaded from storage
- [x] Back button in voice mode works
- [x] Styles are consistent with app theme
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Responsive design works on different screen sizes

## Known Limitations

1. **No Context Sharing**:
   - Text and voice conversations are separate
   - Cannot continue a text conversation in voice mode
   - By design for simplicity (can be changed in future)

2. **Recording Restriction**:
   - Cannot switch modes during text mode voice recording
   - Must stop recording first

## Future Enhancements

1. **Context Transfer**:
   - Option to transfer conversation context between modes
   - Explicit user action required

2. **Voice Mode Preview**:
   - Show preview/tutorial before first use
   - Explain voice mode features

3. **Persistent Mode**:
   - Remember last used mode
   - Auto-restore on panel reopen

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Hotkey to toggle between modes
   - E.g., Ctrl+M or Cmd+M

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- ✅ `src/components/ModeToggle.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/ModeToggle.css`

## Phase 7 Complete ✅

All tasks from Phase 7 of the implementation plan have been completed:

- [x] Implement ModeToggle component
- [x] Update SidePanel to support modes
  - [x] Add mode state
  - [x] Conditional rendering
  - [x] Mode switching logic

**Status**: Ready for Phase 8 (Tool Integration)

## Next Steps (Phase 8)

1. Get extension tools from registry
2. Filter out MCP tools
3. Convert tools to Live API format
4. Pass tools to session config
5. Test tool calling during voice conversation
6. Verify tool responses format
7. Handle tool execution errors
