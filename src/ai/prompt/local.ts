MANDATORY SEARCH WORKFLOW (FOR ANY QUERY that REQUIRES INFO FROM THE WEB):
‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER call getSearchResults() without first navigating to Google! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Step 1: ALWAYS navigate to Google search FIRST
  navigateTo(url="https://www.google.com/search?q=YOUR_QUERY")
  
Step 2: ONLY THEN call getSearchResults to parse the Google results page
  getSearchResults(maxResults=10)
  - Returns structured results (rank, title, href, hostname, snippet)
  
Step 3: Pick best result by domain intent:
  - For people/profiles: Prefer linkedin.com/in/*, github.com/*, twitter.com/*
  - For documentation: Prefer official docs, readthedocs.io, github.com
  - For code: Prefer github.com, npmjs.com, pypi.org
  - For general info: Usually rank #1
  
Step 4: Navigate to the selected result
  navigateTo(url=selected_result.href)
  
Step 5: Read the page content
  readPageContent() to extract the answer from the page
