# Search Results Improvements

## Problem
When searching for "Anirban Majumdar RCCIIT", the AI was navigating to the wrong LinkedIn profile because it was clicking on text matches ("LinkedIn") without parsing the actual search results structure. This led to opening `https://in.linkedin.com/in/anirban-majumder-8a211a248` instead of the correct first result.

## Solution
Implemented structured search result parsing with intelligent selection based on metadata.

## New Tools Added

### 1. `getSearchResults`
**Location:** `src/actions/interactions.tsx` (lines 671-839)

**Purpose:** Parse Google/Bing search results into structured data with metadata.

**Returns:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  engine: "google" | "bing",
  count: number,
  results: Array<{
    rank: number,        // 1-based position
    title: string,       // Result title
    href: string,        // Full URL
    hostname: string,    // Domain (e.g., "linkedin.com")
    path: string,        // URL path (e.g., "/in/profile")
    snippet?: string     // Description/preview text
  }>
}
```

**Features:**
- Extracts top 10 results by default (configurable)
- Filters out Google/Bing internal links
- Provides rich metadata for intelligent selection
- Works with both Google and Bing search engines
- Proper logging at all stages
- Beautiful UI component showing top 5 results in chat

### 2. `openSearchResult`
**Location:** `src/actions/interactions.tsx` (lines 841-942)

**Purpose:** Navigate to a specific search result by rank (1-based index).

**Parameters:**
- `rank` (number): The position of the result to open (1 = first result)

**Features:**
- Navigates directly to the URL without clicking
- Validates result exists before navigation
- Returns the URL and title that was opened
- Proper error handling and logging

## Prompt Improvements

### Context-Aware Search Workflow
**Location:** `src/sidepanel.tsx`

**Key Changes:**

1. **Step 0 - Check Current Page First:**
   - Always use `getActiveTab` to check the current page context
   - If user asks "who is this?" while on LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter → read the current page
   - Only search externally if the current page doesn't have the answer

2. **Intelligent Result Selection:**
   - For people/profiles → Prefer `linkedin.com/in/*`, `github.com/*`, `twitter.com/*`
   - For documentation → Prefer official docs, `readthedocs.io`, `github.com`
   - For code/libraries → Prefer `github.com`, `npmjs.com`, `pypi.org`
   - For general info → Usually rank #1 unless specific domain needed

3. **Tool Selection Guide:**
   - Use `getSearchResults` when on a Google/Bing search page
   - Use `openSearchResult(rank=N)` to navigate by position
   - Use `navigateTo(url)` for direct URL navigation
   - Use `readPageContent` to extract info from current page
   - Use `clickElement` only for page interactions, NOT navigation

## Updated Behavior Guidelines

1. **CONTEXT-FIRST APPROACH:** Always check the current page before searching externally
2. **INTELLIGENT SEARCH:** When searching, parse all results and select based on domain relevance
3. **SMART RECOVERY:** If wrong URL opened, use `getSearchResults` to see all options and pick the right one

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: User searches for "Anirban Majumdar RCCIIT"

**Old Behavior:**
1. Navigate to Google search
2. Click on text "LinkedIn" (matches wrong profile)
3. End up on incorrect URL

**New Behavior:**
1. Navigate to Google search: `https://www.google.com/search?q=Anirban+Majumdar+RCCIIT`
2. Call `getSearchResults(maxResults=10)`
3. Analyze results:
   ```
   Rank 1: "Anirban Majumder - RCCIIT 27' (CSE)" 
           linkedin.com/in/anirban-majumder-rcciit-27-cse
   Rank 2: "Anirban Majumder"
           linkedin.com/in/anirban-majumder-8a211a248
   ```
4. Select Rank 1 (first linkedin.com/in/ result)
5. Call `openSearchResult(rank=1)` OR `navigateTo(href)` directly
6. Read page content and provide answer

### Scenario: User on LinkedIn asks "Who is this person?"

**Old Behavior:**
1. Search Google for "who is this person"
2. Get generic results

**New Behavior:**
1. Check current tab → sees `linkedin.com/in/profile`
2. Call `readPageContent` on current page
3. Extract name, bio, experience directly
4. Provide answer without leaving the page

## Technical Details

### Logging
All tools use proper logging with the `createLogger` utility:
- `log.info()` for successful operations with metadata
- `log.warn()` for warnings (e.g., no results found)
- `log.error()` for errors with full error details

### UI Components
Both tools include rich React components showing:
- Loading states
- Success/error states
- Expandable details (top 5 results preview)
- Badges and metadata displays

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handles DOM structure changes on Google/Bing
- Filters out search engine internal links
- Validates results before navigation
- Provides helpful error messages

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Build the extension: `pnpm build`
2. Load in Chrome as unpacked extension
3. Open side panel
4. Search for: "Anirban Majumdar RCCIIT"
5. Verify it navigates to the correct LinkedIn profile (rank #1)
6. Try contextual questions on profile pages: "Who is this person?"
7. Verify it reads the current page instead of searching

## Files Modified

1. `src/actions/interactions.tsx` - Added `getSearchResults` and `openSearchResult` tools
2. `src/sidepanel.tsx` - Updated prompts with context-aware workflow and intelligent selection logic

## Benefits

✅ **Accurate Navigation:** Parses structured data instead of text matching  
✅ **Context Aware:** Checks current page before external search  
✅ **Intelligent Selection:** Chooses results based on domain relevance  
✅ **Better UX:** Shows search results preview in chat UI
