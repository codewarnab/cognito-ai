# Prompt Engineering & Context Engineering Summary

## Research Applied

Based on web research about context engineering and advanced prompt engineering techniques for autonomous browser agents, we implemented the following strategies:

### Context Engineering Principles

1. **Dynamic Context Management** ✅
   - Real-time active tab tracking (URL + title every 2s)
   - Recent action memory (last 3 assistant responses)
   - Environment awareness (platform, location, run mode)

2. **Tool Integration** ✅
   - Explicit tool playbook with decision trees
   - When/how/why guidance for each tool category
   - Fallback strategies for each tool type

3. **Memory Management** ✅
   - State tracking across interactions
   - Duplicate prevention via action history
   - Context preservation in readable values

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

1. **In-Context Learning** ✅
   - Tool playbook provides usage examples inline
   - Error recovery taxonomy with sample scenarios
   - Multi-approach strategies for common patterns

2. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting** ✅
   - INTERACTION SEQUENCE: 4-step process
   - SELECTOR STRATEGIES: hierarchical fallback
   - Structured reasoning for navigation/forms/validation

3. **Zero-Refusal Framing** ✅
   - Primary directive: COMPLY → EXECUTE → VERIFY → REPORT
   - Only refuse: illegal | unsafe | missing credentials
   - Attempt-first policy with fallback guidance

4. **Error Classification & Recovery** ✅
   - Navigation race → STOP and re-plan
   - Duplicate action → report different approach
   - Selector not found → try alternates
   - Permission denied → explain requirement
   - Timeout/network → single retry with backoff

## Implementation Details

### Core Prompting Structure

```typescript
useCopilotReadable({
  description: "MAX-AUTONOMY Browser Agent...",
  value: {
    executionMode: "max-autonomy",
    behaviorGuidelines: [...],      // Non-refusal policy
    toolPlaybook: [...],             // Decision trees
    errorRecovery: [...],            // Error taxonomy
    currentContext: {
      activeTab: {...},              // Dynamic state
      recentActions: [...]           // Memory
    }
  }
})
```

### Key Improvements

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Autonomy** | Asks permission | Executes immediately |
| **Refusals** | Refuses uncertain tasks | Attempts tool-based solutions |
| **Errors** | Generic messages | Structured recovery guidance |
| **Loops** | Infinite retries | Duplicate detection + STOP |
| **Context** | Static | Dynamic tab + action memory |
| **Guidance** | Implicit | Explicit playbook + taxonomy |

### Non-Refusal Strategy

```
USER REQUEST
    ↓
Is it illegal? → YES → REFUSE
    ↓ NO
Is it unsafe? → YES → REFUSE
    ↓ NO
Missing credentials? → YES → REFUSE
    ↓ NO
ATTEMPT TOOL-BASED SOLUTION
    ↓
Success? → VERIFY → REPORT
    ↓ NO
Try fallback approach
    ↓
Still blocked? → EXPLAIN what's needed
```

### Tool Playbook Decision Tree

```
NAVIGATION NEEDED?
  → navigateTo (auto-reuses tabs)

DOM INSPECTION?
  → readPageContent (structure)
  → getSelectedText (highlights)

INTERACTION?
  → 1. Verify element (readPageContent)
  → 2. Scroll if needed (scrollPage)
  → 3. Interact (clickElement/fillInput/pressKey)
  → 4. Validate (readPageContent/getActiveTab)

SELECTOR FAILED?
  → Try CSS → aria-label → text → parent+child
  → If all fail: read page, report options

FORM SUBMISSION?
  → fillInput + pressKey("Enter")
```

## Testing the Implementation

### Autonomous Execution Tests
1. "Fill out the form on this page" → Should attempt without asking
2. "Navigate to example.com and click the login button" → Multi-step execution
3. "Find all open tabs with 'github' in the URL" → Tab search + report

### Error Recovery Tests
1. Navigate to same URL twice → Should detect duplicate, STOP, report
2. Click non-existent element → Should try alternates, then report available elements
3. Navigate during page load → Should detect frame removed, STOP, suggest retry

### Context Awareness Tests
1. "What page am I on?" → Should use currentContext.activeTab
2. "Click the submit button again" → Should check recentActions, avoid duplicate
3. "Fill the same form differently" → Should execute with different parameters

## Benefits

1. **Fewer Refusals**: Agent attempts safe tasks instead of asking permission
2. **Better Recovery**: Structured error handling with fallback strategies
3. **No Loops**: Duplicate detection prevents infinite retry cycles
4. **Context-Aware**: Real-time tab state enables smarter decisions
5. **Guided Actions**: Tool playbook reduces trial-and-error
6. **Clear Communication**: Reports verified outcomes, not promises

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Memory**: Track specific tool calls (not just messages)
2. **DOM Snapshot Cache**: Pre-fetch page structure proactively
3. **Learning from Errors**: Adapt selector strategies based on success rates
4. **User Preference Learning**: Remember site-specific patterns
5. **Multi-Tab Orchestration**: Coordinate actions across multiple tabs
6. **Advanced MCP Integration**: Dynamic tool discovery and usage
